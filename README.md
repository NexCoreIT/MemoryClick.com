# Laravel Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of cloning and running a Laravel project. Follow these steps to get your project up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) (version 7.3 or higher)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A web server like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/download.html)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) or another database management system

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zidankhan86/Real-Ested-Photo-Edit-Web-App.git
cd Real-Ested-Photo-Edit-Web-App
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer update
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own environment configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Step 3:Generate Key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Open the `.env` file and update the following lines to match your environment:

```env
APP_NAME=Laravel
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

Generate the application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

## Step 4: Set Up the Database

Create a new database for the project in your database management system (e.g., MySQL).

Run the database migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

(Optional) Seed the database with sample data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

## Step 5: Serve the Application

You can now serve the application using the built-in PHP server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

By default, this will start the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Additional Steps

If you're working in a team or deploying to production, consider these additional steps:

- **Version Control**: Ensure your `.env` file is not committed to version control by adding it to your `.gitignore` file.
- **Caching**: Optimize your configuration and routes for better performance:
  ```bash
  php artisan config:cache
  php artisan route:cache
  ```

## Conclusion

You should now have your Laravel project up and running. For more information on Laravel, visit the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).

Happy coding!!!!
